				Stephanie Michelle (Stephanie M. Aldrich, JD)  became a criminal defense and family law attorney and wife, because thatâ€™s what was expected. She wanted to help other women and realized that her chosen profession disconnected her from relationship. She busted through the mold, designing a livelihood that embraces both her coaching and legal and analytical gifts to help other women live in their light and create a life of their dreams. Her mission is to help people protect those things that they treasure most in life, as an attorney she will look out for your legal interests and as a coach she looks after your dreams and what you want to create.</p>

			<p class="center">Whether it be if your family life is falling apart and you need help getting back on track and putting the pieces back together. She will be your coach and friend and biggest supporter to help you get where you say you want to be. You see her philosophy is that we are not given more than we cannot handle and that those huge things that throw our lives upside down are actually opportunities to create the life that we want. Without those experiences we would not be who we are now. All of the things that felt so painful and unbearable at the time, made her into the amazing loving woman that she is today. She believes she is here to guide people through the legal process and to guide you in life, so that you can create that life that you have always dreamed.</p>
